Popcritic Backend Express API

HTTP Status Codes our API represents

200 = Successful HTTP request
204 = No result for HTTP request (results.rowCount === 0)
400 = Bad HTTP request (incorrent HTTP parameter)
404 = No Endpoint for HTTP request (GET /directors (no directors endpoint))
500 = Internal Server Error (accepted request but error in server)

We create endpoints in Routes, which are tied to Controllers, which are tied to
HTTP methods querying our PostgreSQL Database.

These endpoints are queryed by out Front end application when the user actions a 
request.
